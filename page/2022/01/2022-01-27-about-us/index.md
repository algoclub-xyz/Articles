Hey-hey everybody ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex and I am a software engineer. I really like algorithms and want to improve my english! [My very first post](https://algoclub.xyz/2022/01/18/hello-world-1/) should explain the purpose of this blog better!

My team is only a few people large but we are doing our best to keep the content interesting and fresh. Currently we have two periodical rubrics: [Solving Leetcode](https://algoclub.xyz/category/solving-leetcode/) and [Grokking Data Structures & Algorithms](https://algoclub.xyz/category/algorithms-and-data-structures/). We are going to bear with a weekly schedule but, unfortunately, cannot promise it ðŸ˜¢

Anyway, in the meantime, while you're waiting for new articles you can check our other channels:

- [Our youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF3WUU7y6sSIu8dVQ1KbsNQ)
- [Our telegram channel](https://t.me/algoclub)

Feel free to subscribe and join them.

Keep the spirit and see you!
